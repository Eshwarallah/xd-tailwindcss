![Tailwindcss for Adobe XD](/screenshot.png?raw=true "Tailwindcss for Adobe XD")

## Installation

To begin with download the [latest version of the Adobe XD file](https://github.com/mrcrille/xd-tailwindcss/blob/master/Tailwindcss%20for%20Adobe%20XD.xd)

When you installed the file it's time to add it to your Adobe Cloud Documents by doing following.
1. Open the downloaded file.
2. Goto `File > Save As` and select Cloud Documents in the `Save to` field.
3. Rename the file, we don't want it to be called `Copy of Tailwindcss for Adobe XD` ðŸ™„
4. Hit that Save button and begin using it in your next Adobe XD design. ðŸŒŸ _(Psst you still need to click `Link Assets` in the new project and select the `Tailwindcss for Adobe XD` file)_

## Contributing
You and everybody else is welcome to commit and help expand the library with components. The only requirement is that it's possible to make it without using Tailwindcss plugins.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to don't break anything you don't want to change.
